 <title>My birthday party!!</title>
 <link>http://tn42.com/b/my-birthday-party</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I have been so busy this summer, I barely have any time to write blogs, but here I am writing this one because my dad kept telling me I better do it! I had my birthday party as some of you know from my other post, it was AWESOME! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a fairy party that my mom planned for me and all my friends had a lot of fun. We went swimming for a long time and then when we started our crafts, I couldn&#039;t believe it, but it started raining! It&#039;s never rained on my birthday before. The best part though, was seeing the rainbow on my birthday! It was like the rainbow fairies sent it just for me!&lt;/p&gt;

This is my birthday warning. It&#039;s coming up in three days and I am so excited! I&#039;m having my birthday party next weekend and its going to be all about fairies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom and I have some great games planned, and lots of crafts to do with my friends. Some of the stuff we&#039;re gonna do is: butterfly finger puppets, make our own pixie dust, pin the wings on the fairy, make bead bracelets, and we&#039;re going to play musical flowers!&lt;/p&gt;
